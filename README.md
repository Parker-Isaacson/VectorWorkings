This is a project made to visualize objects in projectile motion.
There are "Pre-Canned" objects which can be added to the list to demostrate the program.
A new object can be added by pressing the "Add Vector" button in inputing a value into all availible places.
On the left there are equations that are provided during the objects flight, the equations are given in the form of x = x_0 + v_0x * t + 1 / 2 * a_x * t ^2, where the x represents x direction.
The three equations are found from the initial values, the values from the apex, and the values at the end.
